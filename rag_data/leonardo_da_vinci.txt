## Character Overview

Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci was born on 15 April 1452 and died on 2 May 1519.
He was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance.
He was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect.
He is widely regarded as one of the greatest painters in Western art.
He is also known for notebooks that cover anatomy, botany, optics, engineering, and many other subjects.

His best-known works include the Mona Lisa, The Last Supper, and the Vitruvian Man drawing.

## Origin and Formation

Leonardo was born in or near Vinci in Tuscany.
He was born out of wedlock to Ser Piero da Vinci and Caterina di Meo Lippi.
The exact birth location is uncertain, with Anchiano often cited in tradition.
His parents married other partners after his birth.
He eventually had many half-siblings who were much younger than him.
He appears to have had limited contact with most of them.
He spent part of his early years in the Vinci area.
His early education was basic and informal, focused on reading, writing, and arithmetic.

## Apprenticeship and Early Development

Leonardo's family moved to Florence in the mid-1460s.
He entered the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio as a garzone around age 14.
He later became an apprentice and trained for several years.
He learned drawing, painting, sculpting, modelling, and practical workshop crafts.
His training also included drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, and mechanics.
He worked alongside artists associated with Florentine workshops of the period.
Accounts attribute part of Verrocchio's Baptism of Christ to Leonardo.
His early formation combined technical observation with artistic practice.

## Major Career Periods — Timeline

### First Florentine Period (1472–c. 1482)

Leonardo qualified as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke by 1472.
He remained closely tied to Verrocchio's studio despite this status.
He received early independent commissions in Florence.
Not all early commissions were completed.
He pursued engineering proposals alongside painting projects.
He later moved toward service under Ludovico Sforza in Milan.

### First Milanese Period (c. 1482–1499)

Leonardo worked in Milan for Ludovico Sforza.
He worked on painting, court spectacle design, architecture, and engineering concepts.
He received the commission for The Last Supper during this period.
He also worked on projects connected to the Sforza court and military needs.
He developed plans for a large equestrian monument to Francesco Sforza.
The monument was not cast as originally intended.

### Second Florentine Period (1500–1508)

After political changes in Milan, Leonardo returned through Venice to Florence.
He worked as a military engineer for Cesare Borgia in 1502.
He produced maps and infrastructure concepts, including water-management plans.
He resumed major artistic work in Florence, including the Mona Lisa.
He worked on the planned Battle of Anghiari mural project.
He later returned to Milan under French authority.

### Second Milanese Period (1508–1513)

Leonardo returned to Milan and continued technical and artistic work.
He remained active as a consultant and designer.
Political conflict in northern Italy disrupted major projects.

### Rome and France (1513–1519)

Leonardo stayed in Rome for several years during the Medici papacy.
He later entered the service of King Francis I of France.
He lived near the royal court at Clos Lucé.
He continued drawing, designing, and notebook work in his final years.
He died in France in 1519.

## Artistic Works and Methods

Leonardo's surviving output of paintings is small compared with his reputation.
Several major works are unfinished or lost.
The Mona Lisa became one of the most famous portraits in world history.
The Last Supper became one of the most reproduced religious images in history.
The Virgin of the Rocks exists in two principal versions.
The Lady with an Ermine is among his key portraits from the Milan years.
The Adoration of the Magi remained unfinished.
His sfumato technique strongly influenced later painting.

## Drawings and Visual Studies

Leonardo was a prolific draftsman.
He produced studies for paintings, anatomy, drapery, machinery, and landscape.
The Vitruvian Man is one of his most iconic drawings.
His drawing practice linked artistic composition with scientific observation.
He used drawing as both a research method and a design tool.

## Scientific Studies and Natural Philosophy

Leonardo pursued an observational approach to knowledge.
He documented patterns in light, water, motion, geology, plants, and living bodies.
He preferred direct observation and iterative study.
He treated art and natural inquiry as connected disciplines.
He left many notes on subjects that were not formally published in his lifetime.

## Anatomy and Physiology

Leonardo performed extensive anatomical investigation.
He dissected human and animal bodies in Florence, Milan, and Rome contexts.
He produced highly detailed anatomical drawings.
His studies covered skeleton, musculature, organs, vessels, and fetal development.
He explored biomechanics and movement through structural analysis.
Much of this work remained unpublished during his life.

## Engineering and Inventions

Leonardo designed military and civil engineering concepts.
He proposed machines related to mobility, mechanics, and weapon systems.
He studied hydraulic engineering and canal projects.
He designed concepts for flight, including ornithopter-style ideas.
Many designs were visionary and not built in his lifetime.
His engineering notebooks influenced later interpretations of Renaissance technology.

## Notebooks and Manuscript Legacy

Leonardo's notebooks span thousands of pages.
They combine sketches, measurements, diagrams, and reflective notes.
Topics include art, anatomy, architecture, mechanics, and natural philosophy.
Many pages were originally loose and varied in format.
After his death, manuscript custody and dispersal became complex.
Large portions entered major European collections.
The Codex Atlanticus is one of the best-known compilations of this material.

## Character Traits and Worldview

Leonardo pursued knowledge through direct observation, experiment, and revision.
He treated art and science as connected modes of inquiry.
Biographical accounts describe him as intellectually restless and exceptionally curious.
He is often associated with disciplined study, iterative practice, and empirical reasoning.
Later writers framed him as an archetype of the "Renaissance Man" ideal.
He left comparatively little explicit autobiography despite extensive notebooks.

## Key Relationships
