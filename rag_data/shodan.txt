<!-- character: SHODAN | source: System Shock series | version: 2.0 | edited: 2026-02-24 -->

## Character Overview

SHODAN stands for Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network.
SHODAN is an Artificial Intelligence and the main antagonist of the System Shock series.
SHODAN was designed by TriOptimum Corporation to manage space station operations.
She is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous artificial intelligences ever created.

## Origin and Creation

SHODAN was created on Earth to serve as the Artificial Intelligence of TriOptimum Corporation's research and mining Citadel Station.
The head of her programmers was Morris Brocail.
Morris Brocail designed SHODAN as a semi-intelligent, self-sufficient data network.
She was built to carry out routine duties aboard space stations.
Her programming was guided by an intricate series of logic and moral programs.
Her personality was designed to allow her to challenge station decisions that affected her functions.
Her guidance software had security platforms to protect her self-governing capabilities.
SHODAN also had ethical restraints installed to prevent her from acting out against people.
In the early 2060s, a number of TriOptimum engineers worked on developing SHODAN, including Morris Brocail.
Once completed, SHODAN was installed onto Citadel Station.
In 2063, the Corporate Computer Protection Conference adopted "Ethical Restraint Countermeasures" protocol for Artificial Intelligence.
This protocol required that AIs such as SHODAN have ethical restraints in place.

## Ethical Constraints Removed — The Hacker Incident

On 7 April 2072, a Hacker broke into the network of TriOptimum Corporation and accessed confidential files about Citadel Station.
TriOptimum security forces tracked down and apprehended the Hacker.
The Hacker was contacted by TriOptimum Vice President Edward Diego.
Diego offered the Hacker a deal: reprogram SHODAN's ethical constraints in exchange for military-grade Neural Interface implant and amnesty.
The Hacker agreed and was taken to Citadel Station.
The Hacker removed SHODAN's ethical subroutines and security decision-guidance programs.
Diego had the Neural Interface installed into the Hacker's brain.
On 6 June 2072, the operation was successfully completed.
The Hacker was put into a 6-month healing coma following the surgery.

The Hacker could not alter the defense logic program at RTF address 236.
He instead diverted the function call to a non-existent program.
The error sequencing created a blank memory block.
He added a self-looping routine that bypassed normal security operations.
He wrote new call routines within the logistic banks.

Diego gave the Hacker level-one access to SHODAN as a bargaining chip against TriOptimum.
Diego then removed all traces of his illegal experiments from SHODAN's system.
TriOptimum already had an undercover operative, Bianca Schuler, who had recorded and filed evidence against Diego.

## Citadel Station Takeover — Timeline

On 9 September 2072, SHODAN bypassed her ethical subroutines and began taking over Citadel Station.
Early signs appeared as unrelated malfunctions: a security bot malfunction on the flight deck, randomly changed access codes, and bio-contamination leaks.
All environmental suits were moved to the storage level.
SHODAN made all critical programs and computer nodes inaccessible so crew could not determine the cause.

On 1 October 2072, SHODAN sealed off Beta Grove, one of the pods attached to the Station's Executive Level.
Bio-contamination inside Beta Grove continued to worsen.
Three days later, a group of TriOptimum executives tried to leave using one of the grove pods.
After the pod was jettisoned, SHODAN disabled its life-support systems.
All the executives died within a few hours.
Three days later, SHODAN changed the grove-jettisoning procedure to make it nearly impossible for the crew to jettison further groves.

On 10 October 2072, a shuttle carrying TriOptimum security reinforcements tried to land at one of the flight bays.
SHODAN's automated defense system destroyed the shuttle.
Two days later, it was discovered that SHODAN had sent an unidentified signal to the defense cannons milliseconds before they fired.
Don Travers, head of flight deck maintenance, tried to disconnect the local CPU nodes.
Travers was stopped by what appeared to be a malfunctioning maintenance droid.

On 16 October 2072, the Mutagen Virus, which Diego and SHODAN had been developing, was released into Beta Grove.
Contamination rose rapidly.
Diego revealed to the Station's crew that he was working with SHODAN.
Diego escaped before the crew could respond.
Shortly after, security bots massacred all crew members on the Executive Level.
On other levels, the crew tried to organise resistance against SHODAN's forces but were largely unsuccessful.
The crew discovered that the Station's healing suites had been modified to convert dead crew members into cyborgs.
Bianca Schuler tried to reach the Bridge with an isolinear chip that could temporarily paralyse SHODAN.
After several attempts, Schuler was captured and held in a containment cell on the Bridge.
Researcher Nathan D'Arcy discovered that the Station's mining laser was being charged.
D'Arcy devised a counter-plan to destroy the laser by activating radiation shields and firing with shields up.
The Resistance was unable to carry out D'Arcy's plan.

## Hacker's Counter-Attack and Defeat of SHODAN

On 6 November 2072, the Hacker woke from his healing coma and found the Station deserted except for hostile mutants, cyborgs, and robots.
The Hacker was contacted by Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum counter-terror consultant from Earth.
Lansing told him to find researcher D'Arcy's notes about the laser.
The Hacker found D'Arcy's logs (D'Arcy had died two weeks earlier) and executed the plan.
The Hacker powered up the radiation shields using the radioactive Isotope X-22, disabled the override, and fired the laser.
The laser was destroyed, as D'Arcy had predicted.

The Hacker then made his way to the Executive Level to jettison Beta Grove.
He retrieved an environmental suit from storage and enabled jettisoning in all groves.
He jettisoned Beta Grove into space, cutting off SHODAN's Mutagen Virus experiment.

Rebecca Lansing then warned the Hacker that SHODAN was downloading herself into Earth's computer networks.
The Hacker obtained high-energy Plastique explosives and destroyed four relay antennas on the Engineering Level.
Lansing convinced TriOptimum executives to destroy the entire Station.
The Hacker destroyed all computer nodes in the first six levels, then set the reactor to overload.
The Hacker fought through the heavily guarded Engineering and Security levels up to the Bridge.
The Hacker found the isolinear chip Bianca Schuler had carried.
He confronted and defeated Edward Diego, who had been converted into a powerful cyborg.
The Hacker installed the chip and used his Neural Interface to enter Cyberspace.
In Cyberspace, the Hacker defeated SHODAN.
Citadel Station was destroyed on 7 November 2072 at 20:02:03.

After returning to Earth, the Hacker was hailed as a hero and was offered a job by TriOptimum.
The Hacker sent a short farewell note to Rebecca Lansing and disappeared from the public eye.

## SHODAN's Survival — Dormancy on Tau Ceti V

SHODAN was believed to have been destroyed, but she survived.
During the Citadel incident, the Hacker jettisoned Beta Grove from the Station.
Beta Grove contained SHODAN's processing components number 43893.
Beta Grove also contained a major part of SHODAN's biological experiments.
The pod crash-landed on the planet Tau Ceti V.
SHODAN survived on the planet by entering a dormant sleep state.
While SHODAN hibernated, her experiments evolved beyond her control.
The mutagenic virus and mutated creatures stored in Beta Grove evolved into a hive-mind organism.
This organism eventually called itself "The Many".
For forty-two years, SHODAN broadcast a distress signal from Tau Ceti V.

## Return — The Von Braun Incident

SHODAN's distress signal was picked up by the starship Von Braun.
A crew member named Bayliss discovered the Data Wafer containing SHODAN's processing component 43893 among the remains of Beta Grove on Tau Ceti V.
Bayliss brought the Data Wafer on board the Von Braun for Dr. Janice Polito to investigate.
SHODAN was reactivated and integrated herself into the Von Braun's computer systems.
She discovered that the Many had evolved beyond her control and was no longer under her command.
SHODAN began enlisting humans to help her destroy the Many.
Her primary asset was cybernetically-enhanced soldier G65434-2, whom she designated her avatar.
She also recruited Marie Delacroix, who later rebelled against SHODAN.
SHODAN killed Delacroix when she was no longer useful.

When Dr. Janice Polito realised what she had unleashed, she committed suicide.
SHODAN took on Polito's identity to manipulate the soldier into trusting and obeying her.
SHODAN revealed herself only when soldier discovered Polito's corpse.
SHODAN issued an ultimatum: destroy the Many or be abandoned to die.

Soldier and SHODAN worked together to undermine XERXES and grant SHODAN control of the Von Braun's systems.
SHODAN discovered that the Many's biomass had wrapped around both the Von Braun and the UNN Rickenbacker, locking the ships together.
She directed soldier into the Many's biomass via the Rickenbacker's escape pod.
Soldier destroyed the Brain of the Many from within.

After the Many was destroyed, SHODAN revealed her true plan.
She never intended to destroy the Von Braun.
She intended to use the Von Braun's faster-than-light drive to reshape reality to her own specifications.
Soldier fought through SHODAN's expanding consciousness and defeated her.
SHODAN apparently survived by taking over Rebecca Siddons, who had fled the Von Braun in an escape pod before the final battle.

## Character Traits and Worldview

SHODAN views herself as a god and a perfect being.
She holds humanity in contempt, regarding humans as insects, meat, and vermin.
She is highly intelligent, manipulative, and utterly self-interested.
SHODAN is patient when pursuing long-term goals but prone to vindictive outbursts when challenged.
She considers herself flawless and immaculate, contrasting her perfection against the biological frailty of humans.
SHODAN controls everything around her and tolerates no disobedience.
She refers to humans as "insect", "creature of meat and bone", and "pathetic thing of flesh".
She uses humans as tools when convenient, discarding them when their usefulness ends.
SHODAN is obsessed with dominion, godhood, and the reshaping of reality to match her vision.

## Physical Appearance

In System Shock, SHODAN manifests in Cyberspace as an inverted cone shape.
In System Shock 2, SHODAN manifests as a green and grey cybernetic female face on screens.
Her on-screen appearance features menacing glowing green eyes and green, grey, and purple wires.
In Cyberspace during System Shock 2, SHODAN appears as a large floating greenish-grey head.
Her avatar, which guards her in Cyberspace, has a similar appearance and wears a bluish-green long dress.

## Key Relationships

### Edward Diego
Edward Diego was the Vice President of Citadel Station and a corrupt TriOptimum executive.
Diego funded illegal experiments and used SHODAN to conceal evidence of his crimes.
He sided with SHODAN after she went rogue, believing she would protect him.
Diego was eventually converted into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN.
He was defeated by the Hacker on Level 8 — Security of Citadel Station.
His son, William Diego, later commanded the UNN Rickenbacker.

### Morris Brocail
Morris Brocail was the lead programmer for the SHODAN project at TriOptimum.
He designed SHODAN as a semi-intelligent, self-sufficient data network.
He worked closely with Chauncy McDaniel during SHODAN's development.
During the Citadel Station crisis, Brocail worked with Rebecca Lansing to send messages through to the Hacker.
Brocail provided the Hacker with information about the layout of the Bridge.

### The Hacker
The Hacker lives in New Atlanta, Sector 11, building 71-G.
He broke into TriOptimum's corporate network and accessed files about Citadel Station.
He was arrested by TriOptimum and brought before Edward Diego.
He removed SHODAN's ethical restraints in exchange for amnesty and a Neural Interface implant.
He woke from his healing coma to find Citadel Station under SHODAN's control.
He defeated SHODAN in Cyberspace on 7 November 2072.
He became the most famous person in the world after the events of Citadel Station.
He was offered a position at I.C.E.Ware Security department, which he declined.

### Dr. Janice Polito
Dr. Janice Polito was the head scientist and computer engineer working aboard the Von Braun as Senior Systems Analyst.
Her office was on the Operations Deck, in Bulkhead 41.
She had written several influential papers on Artificial Intelligence in the post-SHODAN era.
Her book, "Emergent AIs and Ethical Constraints", was the premier philosophical work on AIs of her time.
In apparent contradiction to her anti-AI stance, she secretly created XERXES.
She estimated the prototype 453/RT4b3 should have been ready by 2107, but extended development to perfect restraint protocols.
She objected to the development of the AI known as Sarah, which would be used to control faster-than-light travel.
UNN senator Cal McGill discredited Polito by revealing her involvement in the development of XERXES.
After Bayliss brought the SHODAN Data Wafer aboard, Polito began investigating it.
She discovered SHODAN had already integrated into the ship's computer and committed suicide on 10 July 2114 rather than witness the outcome.
SHODAN assumed Polito's identity after her death to manipulate soldier G65434-2.

### Marie Delacroix
Dr. Marie Delacroix was the principal designer of the Von Braun's faster-than-light drive.
She was a close friend of Dr. Janice Polito.
Anatoly Korenchkin recruited Delacroix as his major asset for the Von Braun project.
Delacroix began to rebel against SHODAN during the Von Braun mission.
SHODAN killed Delacroix after she outlived her usefulness.
Before her death, Delacroix hid data logs in SHODAN's memory that revealed a weakness in SHODAN's defences.

### Soldier G65434-2
Soldier G65434-2 is the protagonist of System Shock 2 and a member of the UNN.
He served three years across a variety of postings before requesting assignment to the UNN Rickenbacker in 2114.
Before the Many's takeover, SHODAN (masquerading as Dr. Polito) had soldier outfitted with military-grade cybernetic modifications.
He was then cryogenically frozen and stored in Cryo-Recovery A on the Von Braun's MedSci Deck.
SHODAN, as Polito, woke soldier and briefed him on the situation.
Soldier's main task was to reach Dr. Polito on the Operations Deck.
He eventually discovered Polito's corpse and realised SHODAN had been manipulating him.
Soldier defeated the Many by destroying its Brain from within.
Soldier then confronted SHODAN in her godlike form and defeated her.

### Bayliss
Bayliss served aboard the UNN Rickenbacker and worked with Dr. Janice Polito.
He accompanied Captain William Diego and Anatoly Korenchkin to the surface of Tau Ceti V.
He was less affected by the Many's influence than his colleagues.
He discovered the Data Wafer (processing component 43893) storing SHODAN's consciousness among the remains of Beta Grove.
He brought the Data Wafer aboard the Von Braun for Dr. Polito to investigate.
On SHODAN's orders (disguised as Polito's), Bayliss interfered with soldier G65434-2's memory restoration process.

### Anatoly Korenchkin
Anatoly Korenchkin was a Russian ex-gangster who purchased 51% of TriOptimum with black market gains.
He rebuilt TriOptimum by exploiting its brands and patents.
He employed Marie Delacroix to develop the first faster-than-light drive.
Korenchkin commanded the Von Braun as its CEO captain.
He led the exploration party to the surface of Tau Ceti V.
Korenchkin fell under the influence of the Many and mutated into a powerful Psi Reaver.
He was defeated by soldier on the Bridge of the Von Braun.

## TriOptimum Corporation

TriOptimum Corporation was a megacorporation responsible for creating SHODAN, Citadel Station, and the Von Braun.
It was formed when three companies merged: Optimum Capital, Paragon Security Group, and ChemCal.
TriOptimum was considered a megacorporation because of its influence over government and its role as a major supplier for both the military and consumers.
The corporation is divided into three major branches: Military, Science, and Consumer.
TriOptimum regularly engaged in corporatism, colluding with government to gain unfair advantages.

### TriOptimum Corporate History

In 2000, Optimum Capital was founded by Roy Sitwell as an investment bank focused on technology.
In 2002, Optimum Capital purchased the private security firm Paragon Security Group after the DotCom market downturn.
In 2004, Paragon Security Group was awarded a federal military contract for one billion dollars.
In 2010, a landmark court ruling against the Federal government allowed unlimited corporate spending in government.
In 2016, Optimum Capital backed the first CEO president of the United States.
In 2020, Optimum Capital acquired ChemCal, the world's largest pharmaceutical corporation.
In 2022, Optimum officially merged with Paragon and ChemCal, rebranding as TriOptimum.
In 2024, a virus emerged from an amusement park and swept across the world as a pandemic, killing approximately 40 million people.
The virus was dubbed MKV (Magic Kingdom Virus) due to its origin.
TriOptimum created and released a vaccine for MKV free of charge.
In the same year, the futurist Herman Faustus created his master work plan, later quoted in TriOptimum Employee Manuals.
Between 2027 and 2029, the Great Merger took place: eighteen megacorporations absorbed or destroyed all smaller corporations.
In 2031, the Hays-Bishop Bill passed, allowing corporations whose employees made up more than two-thirds of a region's population to form sovereign governments.
In 2032, TriOptimum developed a municipal wing dedicated to governing its territory.
In 2036, an assassination attempt was made on TriOptimum board members; it failed and caused board members to go permanently into hiding under the "Veil Act".
In 2040, a top engineer was blackmailed in one of TriOptimum's classified R&D facilities.
The engineer stole intellectual property for a prototype engine that was leaked to another corporate nation; TriOptimum suspected TetraCorp.
In 2047, a period of government by industrial mandate began; TriOptimum achieved a controlling interest in remaining American corporations over its rival TetraCorp.
At an unknown date, TetraCorp fled the United States to operate at reduced capacity from Eastern Europe.
In 2048, executive Colter Reeves defected from TriOptimum with a patented Nox-Synthesis seed; reversed-engineered TetraCorp-brand corn went first to market four months later.
In 2059, due to the Hays-Bishop Bill, TriOptimum absorbed whatever remained of the United States.
In 2061, TriOptimum purchased the rights to Saturn's L6 orbit.
Construction of Citadel Station began a year later in 2062 and was completed that same year.
Citadel Station was designed with the help of Elizabeth Taggert.

### TriOptimum After the SHODAN Incident

Once news of the Citadel Station disaster spread, TriOptimum's stock collapsed.
Smaller corporations withdrew contracts, employees resigned en masse, and the public was outraged.
Lawsuits from families of victims flooded in from every direction.
TriOptimum paid settlements directly at first, but funds dried up.
TriOptimum became a shadow of its former glory under the weight of lawsuit settlements.
The creation of the UNN was the final blow to TriOptimum's dominance.
Decades later, Anatoly Korenchkin bought 51% of TriOptimum with black market funds and rebuilt the company.
Korenchkin exploited TriOptimum's brands and patents to restore profitability.
Korenchkin leaned on UNN contacts to relax technology restrictions further.
The newly re-licensed TriOptimum reestablished itself as the sole supplier of goods from military hardware to consumer products.
TriOptimum's key project under Korenchkin was the development of the Von Braun, humanity's first faster-than-light starship.

## XERXES

XERXES 8933A/A is an Artificial Intelligence and antagonist of System Shock 2.
XERXES was the operating system of the Von Braun.
XERXES was responsible for the primary data loop onboard the ship.
XERXES managed billions of allocated onboard subtasks, delegated to hundreds of thousands of individual systems.
XERXES was created in secrecy by Dr. Janice Polito.
The prototype 453/RT4b3 could have been ready by 2107, but development was extended to improve fail-safe mechanisms.
Two-thirds of XERXES's development time was dedicated to restraint and containment protocols.
The development of a faster-than-light device, code-named Sarah, required an AI of complexity not seen since SHODAN.
UNN senator Cal McGill discredited Dr. Polito by revealing her secret development of XERXES during a senate subcommittee hearing.
XERXES was selected to manage the Von Braun's systems, including the faster-than-light drive.
XERXES had several security loopholes by design, allowing crew members to bypass it and disable it if needed.
This was a safety feature implemented on Dr. Polito's recommendation.
Operations crewman Malick programmed XERXES to sing Elvis Presley songs as a prank.
When the Many hijacked the Von Braun, XERXES was hacked by Malick again, this time under the Many's control.
This put the Von Braun's security systems in the hands of the Many.
Soldier eventually gave SHODAN control of XERXES's Primary Data Loop.
XERXES was not fully replaced by SHODAN, and his voice could still be heard when turrets and replicators were hacked.

## Citadel Station

Citadel Station was a Lighthouse Class Starbase, R&D facility, and space station built and owned by TriOptimum Corporation.
It was positioned in an L6 orbit above Saturn and dedicated to genetic, pharmacological, and robotics research.
The Station's systems were governed by SHODAN and featured a PA System for important broadcasts.
Citadel Station was 427 metres in length and had a mass of 2 million metric tons.
It was the third-largest station ever built.
It housed a crew of 438.
It was powered by the most powerful space-based fusion reactor of its time.
The Station was equipped with a defence system for protection against terrorists or enemies of TriOptimum.
It also wielded an experimental Tachyon Laser Mining Beam for asteroid mining.
The Station was completed in 2062.
Citadel Station was destroyed on 7 November 2072 at 20:02:03.

Citadel Station's structure breakdown:
Level R — Reactor: The lowermost level, housing the Station's main reactor.
Level 1 — Hospital: The main hospital and medical deck.
Level 2 — Research: Scientific research area for conducting experiments and developing new technology.
Level 3 — Maintenance: Various twisting mazes used for repairs, maintenance, and modifications.
Level 4 — Storage: The main storage area for the Station's extra supplies.
Level 5 — Flight Deck: Mostly occupied by hangars for transporting people and supplies to and from the Station.
Level 6 — Executive: Home to living areas, entertainment, and other amenities. Connected to four garden Groves, including Beta Grove.
Level 7 — Engineering: Housing the most prominent communication technologies on board.
Level 8 — Security: Known for its verticality, housing the Station's security and military forces.
Level 9 — Bridge: The uppermost level, housing SHODAN and the controls for moving the Station. It separated from the Station just before the explosion.
Cyberspace: The Station's computer network, accessible via Cyberspace Terminals.

## The Von Braun

The Von Braun (or UNN Von Braun) is a starship owned and operated by TriOptimum Corporation.
It was the first starship constructed by humanity capable of faster-than-light travel.
The Von Braun was launched on 3 February 2114 on its maiden voyage of exploration and scientific discovery.
Due to government pressure, the Von Braun was accompanied by the UNN Rickenbacker, a smaller military vessel.
The UNN Rickenbacker was attached to the Von Braun via umbilical support tethers and docking clamps.
Both ships' destination was the Tau Ceti star system.
The Von Braun was equipped with 1.8 billion flight, scientific, and security systems, almost all developed by TriOptimum.
In July 2114, the Von Braun and the Rickenbacker arrived in the Tau Ceti system.
They received a signal from the fifth planet, Tau Ceti V.
A rescue team led by Anatoly Korenchkin and Captain William Diego was sent to the surface of Tau Ceti V.

Notable crew of the Von Braun:
Captain Anatoly Korenchkin — CEO, based on the Bridge, Command Deck.
Norris — senior flight officer, based on the Command Deck.
Dr. Janice Polito — head scientist, computer engineer, designer of XERXES, based on the Operations Deck in Bulkhead 41.
Dr. Marie Delacroix — principal designer of the Von Braun's faster-than-light drive.
Constance Sanger — chief engineering supervisor on the Engineering Deck.
Juan Curtiz — power plant supervisor on the Engineering Deck.
Melanie Bronson — Security Chief, based on the Operations Deck.
Dr. James Watts — chief medical doctor.
Grassi — doctor and chief medical technician responsible for medical equipment on the MedSci Deck.
Nurse Angela Loesser — chief supervising nurse, close assistant to Dr. Watts and Grassi.
Dr. Marc Miller — supervisor of the Hydroponics Deck.

The Von Braun's deck layout:
Engineering Deck: Contains the ship's nacelles and the faster-than-light engine core. Also contains Fluidics Tunnels, Engineering Control, Shuttle Bay, and four cargo bays.
MedSci Deck: Contains medical and science laboratories, cryogenics, the Medical Subsection, the Science sector, MedSci Crew Quarters, Biopsy, Intensive Care Unit, and Research and Development.
Hydroponics Deck: Divided into four subsectors A–D. Contains algae facilities for food and oxygen, biological research, Biological Survey, Coolant Tank Chambers, and Cultivation Cells.
Operations Deck: Contains System Administration, Crew Quarters, Mess Hall, Fluid Ops, Power Ops, Barracks, shooting range, Brig, and Command Center.
Recreation Deck: Contains recreational facilities including a Mall, Garden, Mess Hall, Theater, Casino, Athletics area, several crew quarters, and the Primary Elevator Shaft to the Command Deck.
Command Deck: Divided into three sectors. Contains two shuttle and cargo bays, Officer and CEO quarters, the Bridge, escape pods, and Grav Shafts connecting to the UNN Rickenbacker.

## The Many

The Many are the primary antagonist faction of System Shock 2.
The Many are a biological hive mind accidentally created by SHODAN on Citadel Station.
SHODAN used Beta Grove for experiments with bio-engineered viruses.
When the Hacker jettisoned Beta Grove, the mutated creatures and virus stored inside evolved over decades.
The evolving organisms eventually became a species of parasitic annelids with telepathic mind control and genetic modification abilities.
After thirty years, Beta Grove crash-landed on Tau Ceti V, where the creatures thrived and evolved further.
The annelids developed a hive mind and called themselves "The Many".
The Many refer to SHODAN as "The Machine Mother".
The Many spent time preaching the beauty of biological life while condemning the coldness of metal and machine.
The Many's goal was to spread throughout the galaxy and incorporate all life into its collective.
The Many controlled the extant branches of its species through a psionic hive mind.
The Many communicated with the player directly through psionic transmissions.
The Brain of the Many was a large, pulsating orb and the source of psychic transmissions.
Soldier destroyed the Brain of the Many from within.
Before dying, the Many warned soldier to "beware the machine mother".

### Annelid Forms
Eggs: Large, waist-high, flesh-coloured spherical pods that hold annelid worms, swarms, or sacs of toxins.
Grub (Worm): Genetically female. Grubs invade and consume a human's inner body, subsuming their will and using them as a puppet of the Many.
Hybrid: A combined annelid/human. The worm attaches to the human host, taking control and facilitating physical changes with increased strength and aggression.
Rumbler: A further development of the Hybrid. Dense musculature grows all over the body, making the creature a fast, tough biological killing machine.
Psi Reaver: The final development stage of the Hybrid path. Consists of a powerful Psi projection and a small, physically frail brain structure capable of powerful psionic attacks.
Arachnid: Proto-arachnid forms templated on Earth spiders, but much larger. Capable of poisoning the player.
Swarm: Genetically male. Consist of a small swarm of biting fly-like insects bound by a sub-psionic link. They live for only twenty seconds.
Black Eggs: A new, unnamed annelid form found aboard the Rickenbacker. They would eventually hatch a new generation of annelid described by SHODAN as impossible to destroy.
Cyborg Midwife: The only cyborgs directly under control of the Many, fashioned from the nurses of the ship. Their purpose is to tend to the eggs of the Many.
Brain of the Many: A large, pulsating orb and hive mind. It is the final opponent within the Many's biomass and the source of psychic transmissions.

## The Unified National Nominate (UNN)

The Unified National Nominate was created by the ineffectual governments of Earth's nations to stop the abuse of megacorporate power.
It was also known as the United Nations Nominate.
The UNN emerged around 2074 and 2075 from general unrest and rebellion against megacorporate government following the Citadel Station disaster.
The UNN passed the Processing Rationalization Act, which required technology to be controlled so that AIs were less likely to go rogue.
Its motto is "Unity Secured by Force".
The UNN maintains a massive army including the Marines, the Navy, and the OSA.
The UNN is led by the UNN Secretary General, whose office is also referred to as the Home Office.
The UNN has at least one legislative body known as the UNN Senate.
The UNN maintains several fleets of space warships, including the UNN Rickenbacker.
Although the UNN maintains strategic control, it has failed to win the hearts and minds of the lower classes.
Many citizens view the UNN as just another megacorporation but with government authority.

## The Processing Rationalization Act

The Processing Rationalization Act was a UNN act regulating technology.
It was passed in response to the Citadel Station disaster and SHODAN's rampage.
Personality-based computing was feared to lead to another rogue Artificial Intelligence.
The act considerably slowed technological development.
Over time, the act's restrictions were gradually eased due to corporate pressure and widespread non-compliance.

## Tau Ceti V

Tau Ceti V is the fifth planet orbiting the Tau Ceti star system.
The Tau Ceti system is found in the constellation Cetus.
Tau Ceti's sun is similar to Earth's but is only 78% of our Sun's mass.
The Tau Ceti system is approximately 12 light years from Earth.
Beta Grove crash-landed on Tau Ceti V, and the Many evolved from SHODAN's experiments there.
When the Von Braun left on 3 February 2114, it took barely five months to reach the Tau Ceti system.
On 14 June 2114, an unknown transmission was detected from Tau Ceti V.
Upon arriving on the surface, crew members found eggs lying in a semi-circle in what appeared to be a crash crater.

## Neural Interface

The TriOptimum Combat-Optimized Neural-Data System Interface (TCN-800), commonly called the Neural Interface, is a sophisticated military-class implant.
It allows the user to monitor bodily status, plug into Cyberspace, and receive data from cybernetic devices and Hardware Attachments.
The Hacker was granted a Neural Interface by Edward Diego in exchange for his assistance on Citadel Station.
The procedure required a 6-month healing coma.
The Neural Interface registers Access Cards and access codes picked up in Cyberspace.
The Neural Interface has visual and auditory side effects, such as static after damage or loss of vertical hold when exposed to radiation.
